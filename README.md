# ASTR-6410
Code and Data from my first year grad class with Dr. Anil Seth
This is specifically for our final project. My task was to take data from the VERITAS telescope and then use a Lomb-Scargle Periodogram to determine the orbital period of LSI+61 303, a high mass x-ray binary in the constellation Cassiopeia.
I was not able to get the data downloaded as a ".dat" file to be able to view the data appropriately, so unforunately I was unable to use my code that I adapted from the astroML textbook code.
Included in this repository is the .root file with the data and my python code that I could use if I had clearer data.
